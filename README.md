Map: When a user visit the site, they should be able to toggle on/off the map layer you published above.
Map Design: 50% of the grade will be evaluated by your map design. You will need to explain what you have done to design a visually appealing map layer. Factors should be considered include the Components included (from an existing style), and the Radius, Color, Blur, Opacity, etc. from your uploaded dataset.

Edited the csv file to better categorize the description into different categories, the categories are as follows:
1. Multi-vehicle incident
2. Two vehicle incident
3. Single vehicle incident
4. Stalled vehicle
5. Road closure
6. Incident involving pedastrian
7. Traffic light issues

Different color for each category
Reduced to radius of the circles to accurately portray the location of incident
Reduced to opacity to 0 for better visibility
Changed the basic map template to a more monochrome one to allow the markers to stand out.
